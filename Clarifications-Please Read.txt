Hi, this is a document to clarify the game rules and which project to open
The file named "Project2" is the one with the tests, it works with the console instead of a GUI
the file named "Project2Gui" is the official one

Game Rules:
When opening the game, there are 9 buttons on each side
select five of these buttons for each side

You can start a new game, or load your previous save
(the saves are automatic)

when starting the game, troop information is displayed on the right side of the screen
The gold box highlights which troop you are using right now

on the info screen, there will be 3 buttons
click a button, and some buttons on the left screen will enable
click one of these "select" buttons to apply the action to that troop
click "choose" to confirm your choice

now repeat with the other troops
this is meant to be a 2 player game, a player for each side

You can exit out at any time, and the game will autosave
